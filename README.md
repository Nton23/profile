This is my profile page.
Will be spending time to build it with HTML and tailwind-CSS for now and will add JS to it later.
-05/19/23 : Redo the whole page. I want to make it simple. It will have 2 screens and a sticky navbar. The first screen will have an introduction and the second screen will have display projects.
When the the screen size is mobile, the nav bar will turn into a hamburger and it will move as the user scrolls up/down the page. The nav bar will contain 3 <a> links, a home, projects, and a night/day mode.
